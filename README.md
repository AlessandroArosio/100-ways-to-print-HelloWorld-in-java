This is a fun quest to find out different ways to print "Hello, World!" in java. It helps me refresh some concepts and it's a good exercise to think of new methods (java pun) to write a Hello World program.

[2] Using Command Line arguments

[3] Constructors!

[4] Am I inheriting multiple classes?

[5] Create a file. Write a file. Read a file. Thug life!

[6] Do I have to implement that?

[7] Swinging Buttons.

[8] Shh! Thread is sleeping.

[9] Runnable animation with a slice of Random

[10] Brute force. This is going to take a while (loop pun!).
